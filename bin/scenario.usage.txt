Usage:

  scenario --path <directory path>

    Initialises a suite of tests built on scenario. Each .js file inside the test
    directory exports a function with a scenario argument. Each test registers its
    scenario and definitions with the scenario test runner, and the tests are
    executed.

    -c  [--config] <config file path>    Path to a JSON array of files to use
